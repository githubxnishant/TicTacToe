Presenting my Tic Tac Toe gameâ€”HTML for structure, CSS for aesthetics, and JavaScript for dynamic gameplay. This web application offers an interactive user experience. HTML provides a foundation, CSS enhances aesthetics, &amp; JavaScript managing gameplay, handles moves, checks for victories, and maintains game state seamlessly.

##  Play Section

This is the play area of the game, which consists of the playground. It has two nav buttons at the top - Home (which redirect to the index section of the game) and Restart (which restarts the game - discards all the progress and set the game to initial stage). It has two players profile - Player X and Player O. If player X score, the points of X wil be increased by 1 otherwise points of Player O will be increased by 1. It also has a third condition, if none of the player score, the game will give a draw alert. After the draw alert, the game will again restart, without losing the points. It will save the points and again restarts the game. The player who score three points will ultimately win the game.

# Future Scope

- In the upcoming future, I will change the colour theme of the web app  so to make it more attractive.
- I will add a multiplayer mode in which multiple player can create a server and play simultaneously at different systems.
- I will add a computer versus mode in which the player can compete with a bot.
